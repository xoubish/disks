# Disks

The idea is to synthesize realistic 3D disk galaxies with GANS, indistingushable from IFU data lets say MUSE. I will start by making 2D disks similar to those in CANDELS and move on to kinematics after getting comfortable with GAN. Ok even before that, I will learn GAN with MNIST example from web. I will add the learning notebooks in this directory as well.
