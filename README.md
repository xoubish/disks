# Disks

The idea is to synthesize realistic 3D disk galaxies with GANS, indistingushable from IFU data lets say by MUSE. I aim to start by making 2D disk images similar to those in CANDELS and move on by adding in kinematics after getting comfortable with GANs. 

Ok even before that, I will learn GAN with MNIST examples from web. I will add the learning notebooks in this directory as well. Starting with a simple GAN implementation in the tensorflow (no keras). found in "MNIST_tf.ipynb"
